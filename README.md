Forked from [Unixkcd]()
Original README is attached below 

changes 
 - use local storage to remeber last seen xkcd comics. Useful for people like me who like to see all of the comics in a sequence so that they are not missing on any.
 - removed insecure http content loading to remove warnings and make it work with rawgit
 - page hosted on Rawgit(https://cdn.rawgit.com/dominicrj23/xkcdfools/master/src/index.html) so that you can use this feature without xkcd actually merging it to their app
 
 
==========

unixkcd
=========

An interactive web interface for the webcomic [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) resembling a Unix terminal. Comics can be browsed and displayed efficiently via the commands "first", "prev", "next", and "last".

Originally created as a joke for April Fools' 2010, the interface is now available at [http://xkcd.com/unixkcd/](http://xkcd.com/unixkcd/).

Use the source, Luke.
