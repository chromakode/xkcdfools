unixkcd
=========

An interactive web interface for the webcomic [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) resembling a Unix terminal. Comics can be browsed and displayed efficiently via the commands "first", "prev", "next", and "last".

Originally created as a joke for April Fools' 2010, the interface is now available at [http://xkcd.com/unixkcd/](http://xkcd.com/unixkcd/).

Use the source, Luke.
